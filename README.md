# Noor E Hidayat â€“ Islamic Landing Page

## Folder Structure
- index.html : Main HTML file where Team Lead will combine all sections
- css/style.css : All team members will add their styles here (with clear comments)
- images/ : UI Designer will provide images and assets here

## Workflow
1. Each member creates their own section file (hero.html, features.html, etc.)
2. Team Lead combines all sections into index.html
3. Use semantic HTML elements (<header>, <section>, <footer>)
4. Follow the design guidelines (colors, fonts, spacing)

## Color Palette
- Islamic Green: #1E5631
- Golden Beige: #F7C59F
- Soft White: #F5F5F5

**Important:** Only Team Lead edits index.html directly. All others work on their own section files and share them for merging.
